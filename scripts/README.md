# data.json

comes from uber eats: https://www.ubereats.com/store/vietnamese-delight-358-w-38th-st/5qOZv-i2RL6G2blPIkGCAw

Save the webpage and look for this data.json in the downloaded html, so that the data.json can be parsed. Unfortunately this doesn't include the imageSrc (yet)

When running the script it automatically writes the menu items, which can change some names and things based on the parsing. Run the script on a clean git to track these changes.
